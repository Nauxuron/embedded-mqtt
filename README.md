# mqtt-codec

An encoder/decoder for the MQTT 3.1.1 protocol in pure Rust.

`no_std` by default, a `std` feature enables extensions.

Originally forked from https://github.com/avranju/mqttparse and
renamed when I added encode support, the original license and
copyright is preserved in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
